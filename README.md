# KGBot
A discord bot working for the KGB.


## Info
This bot is written in javascript with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).  It uses the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) library to interface with the [Discord API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro).

This bot is not meant for most people, it is mostly just a fun project, but if you have nothing else to do like me, this [very messy] code should be an ok jumping off point to creating your own bot.  Have fun and do whatever you want with it :)
## Getting Ready to Run
Follow these steps to prepare to run:
1. Create a discord application with a user. This  [tutorial](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token) is pretty good.
<!--2. Create an `auth.json` file containing the following:
```json
{
  "token": "YOUR-TOKEN-HERE"
}
```
3. Create a `data.json` file containing the following:
```json
{
  "motd": "Hello, Discord!",
  "activity": "you",
  "activity_mode": true,
  "cash": {}
}
```
`motd` is the message of the day, `activity` is the activity that is displayd under the username, and `activity_mode` toggles between watching (`true`) and playing (`false`).  `cash` is a dictionary that stores data on user balances
-->
2. Install node dependancies by running `npm install` in your command line and follow the prompt to setup the JSON files
3. Run by executing `npm start`
4. Change the world with the power of the KGB!

## Usage
### Running
Follow these steps to add your bot to your server:
1. Go to this link (replace the client id in the link with your own): `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=0`
2. Run using `npm start`

### List of commands:
| Command         | Alias   | Arguments       | Description                                                    |
|-----------------|---------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| $ping            | $p       |                 | gives the user the message of the day                          |
| $motd            | $setmotd | \<message>       | Sets the message of the day                                    |
| $activity        | $a       | \<activity>      | Sets the activity                                              |
| $toggle_activity | $ta      |                 | Toggles the activity between Watching and Playing              |
| $cash-init       |          |                 | Initializes the bank account of the user who sends the message |
| $balance         | $bal     | \[user]          | Gets the balance of a user or the user who sends the message   |
| $send            |          | \<user> \<amount> | Sends the specified user the specified amount.                 |

## Configuration
The bot can be configured using the settings.json file.  The basic structure is as follows:
```json
{
    "use_strict": false,
    "initial_balance": 10000,
    "use_balance": true,
    "use_motd": true,
    "c_sym": "â‚½"
}
```
When `use_strict` is set to true the program will exit upon receiving an exception
`initial_balance` is the initial balance for the currency system if applicable.
`use_balance` and `use_motd` define whether or not the balance and motd features are to be used.
`c_sym` is a cryptic name meaning currency symbol that is just a unicode symbol that represents the symbol that is before all currency values.
